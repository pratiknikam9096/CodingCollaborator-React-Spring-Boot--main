## Overview

**CodeFuse** is a real-time, interactive coding platform designed for collaborative programming. It enables multiple developers to write, edit, and execute code simultaneously in a shared environment. With features like AI-powered code suggestions, On Editor Code Compilations , Google authentication, and a Dracula-themed code editor, CodeFuse enhances productivity and teamwork for developers of all levels.

## Features

- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple users can edit code simultaneously in a shared room, with changes synced instantly via Socket.IO.
- **AI-Powered Code Suggestions**: Integrated with Google Gemini AI to provide real-time, context-aware code completions for languages like JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, and C.
- **Code Execution**: Run code directly in the editor using Judge0 API, with support for input and output display.
- **Code Saving**: Save code snippets to MongoDB, associated with user emails, with options to retrieve and delete saved codes.
- **Google Authentication**: Secure login using Firebase Google Authentication for seamless user access.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Dracula-themed CodeMirror editor with support for JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, and C, including auto-close tags/brackets and line numbers.
- **Room Management**: Generate unique room IDs for collaboration sessions and share them easily with a copy-to-clipboard feature.
- **Active Users Display**: Shows all active users in a room with their usernames, emails, and profile photos.
- **Responsive UI**: Modern, vampire-themed UI with modals for saving codes and viewing saved snippets.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Deployed on Vercel (frontend); Spring Boot application as backend.
